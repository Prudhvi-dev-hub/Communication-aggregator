# 📡 Communication Aggregator – Microservices System

A distributed system built using **NestJS + Kafka + Prisma + Elasticsearch + Kibana**, implementing message routing across Email, SMS, and WhatsApp delivery microservices.

# 🚀 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <github-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
```

### 📁 Folder Structure

```
/communication-aggregator
├── task-router-service
├── email-service
├── sms-service
├── whatsapp-service
├── logging-service
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md
```

---

# 📦 2. Install Dependencies (All Microservices)

Run the following inside each service folder:

### **Task Router Service**

```bash
cd task-router-service
yarn install
```

### **Email Service**

```bash
cd ../email-service
yarn install
```

### **SMS Service**

```bash
cd ../sms-service
yarn install
```

### **WhatsApp Service**

```bash
cd ../whatsapp-service
yarn install
```

### **Logging Service**

```bash
cd ../logging-service
yarn install
```

---

# 🗄️ 3. Setup Databases (Prisma Migrations)

### **Task Router**

```bash
cd task-router-service
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### **Email**

```bash
cd ../email-service
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### **SMS**

```bash
cd ../sms-service
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### **WhatsApp**

```bash
cd ../whatsapp-service
npx prisma migrate dev
```

> ⚠️ Logging service does **not** require migrations.

# 🐳 4. Start Kafka, Zookeeper, Elasticsearch, Kibana

From the **project root**:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:

* Kafka
* Zookeeper
* Elasticsearch
* Kibana

### ✔ Validate Services

```bash
docker ps
```

### Check Kafka Logs

```bash
docker logs kafka
```

### Test Elasticsearch

Open in browser:

```
http://localhost:9200
```

### Test Kibana

```
http://localhost:5601
```

(Wait 1–2 minutes for Kibana to boot.)

---

# ▶️ 5. Start All Microservices

Use **separate terminals** for each service.

### 1️⃣ Task Router

```bash
cd task-router-service
yarn start:dev
```

### 2️⃣ Email Service

```bash
cd email-service
yarn start:dev
```

### 3️⃣ SMS Service

```bash
cd sms-service
yarn start:dev
```

### 4️⃣ WhatsApp Service

```bash
cd whatsapp-service
yarn start:dev
```

### 5️⃣ Logging Service

```bash
cd logging-service
yarn start:dev
```

---

# 📨 6. Test the System (Send Request)

Send a POST request to Task Router:

### **Endpoint**

```
POST http://localhost:3001/route
```

### Sample Email Payload

```json
{
  "channel": "email",
  "to": "user@example.com",
  "subject": "Welcome!",
  "body": "Your OTP is 1234"
}
```

### 🔄 Expected Flow

1. Task Router → publishes to `send.email`
2. Email Service → consumes & simulates delivery
3. Email Service → publishes logs to `logs.delivery.email`
4. Logging Service → consumes logs
5. Logs stored inside Elasticsearch
6. View logs in Kibana

---

# 📊 7. View Logs in Kibana

Visit:

```
http://localhost:5601
```

### Steps:

1. Go to **Discover**
2. Create index pattern:

```
logs.*
```

3. Set time filter → "Last 15 minutes"
4. Explore logs from:

   * Task Router
   * Email
   * SMS
   * WhatsApp
   * Logging Service

---

# 🧪 8. Test All Channels

### SMS Test

```json
{
  "channel": "sms",
  "to": "+1234567890",
  "body": "Your code is 8899"
}
```

### WhatsApp Test

```json
{
  "channel": "whatsapp",
  "to": "+9876543210",
  "body": "Hello from WhatsApp!"
}
```

---

# 🧹 Optional Cleanup

Stop microservices:

```
Ctrl + C
```

Stop Docker stack:

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

# 🔐 Environment Variables Required

Each service must contain a `.env` file.

### **task-router-service/.env**

```
PORT=3001
KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092
```

### **email-service/.env**

```
PORT=3002
KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092
```

### **sms-service/.env**
